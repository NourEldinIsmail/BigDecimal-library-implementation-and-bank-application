# BigDecimal-library-implementation-and-bank-application
This repo was created for an assignment for OOP course It was done by Nour El-din, Ahmed Yehia, and Mohanad Tahawy.
The repo contains two main projects:
- BigDecimal library for C++ to be able to use numbers with large sizes with the ability to do adding and subtracting operations
- Bank Application which simulates a banking system to use OOP concepts

The files maybe messy a bit but we are still proud of that work and later on we learned to make our workspaces more organized.
